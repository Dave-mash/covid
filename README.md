# Covid API App
[![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/timscodebase/covid/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/timscodebase/covid)

I am using the Covid-19 API from https://disease.sh/ to visually display realtime covid date state-by-state.

This project to both a learning opportunity for me and a service I can do as a dev.
