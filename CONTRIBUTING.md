# Covid API App
## Contributions Guidlines

This project is a fun API project to help me better fetch and manipulate, and present data.  

As far as guidelines, I really do  not have any.

Nice to haves:
- Hook to fetch data (i have never been able to get examples to work with me code)
- Better utilization of StyledComponents
- A better SVG map to put more information on.
- Have fun! If you have and idea of something to add and you feel it adds value to the overall purpose of the app, then go nuts!!!
